v16 (19-05-2017)
-------------------

1- remove 'fold.png' as ST now wont respect it and will use the default instead.
2- fixed the sidebar closed/opened folder icon size.
3- fixed tab list icon.
4- replaced the tabset left/right arrows with the default theme ones because the slim arrows were being pixelated after the latest dev update.
   also note that enlarging the icons can also cause the same thing, as a temp solution use
   (
        "Seti_no_scroll_icons": true,
        "mouse_wheel_tabswitch": true,
    )
